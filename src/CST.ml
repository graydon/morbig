(**

    The type for concrete syntax trees of POSIX shell scripts. These
    trees are produced by the Morbig parser.

    This type definition refers directly to the grammar production
    rules of the POSIX standard. We use the following convention to
    name data constructors: given a rule [A -> P1 ... PN] of the
    grammar, the constructor for this rule starts with the name of the
    non terminal A and continues with the names of producers [Pi]
    appearing in the right-hand-side of the production rule. We do not
    need types for operators and reserved words.

    These concrete syntax trees are actually richer than the
    production trees defined by the grammar. Indeed, they also embed
    concrete syntax trees for WORDs while the grammar sees WORDs are
    mere tokens. For instance, [echo `cat bar`] is interpreted by the
    grammar as a simple command with two WORDs [echo] and [`cat bar`].
    Morbig does not stop its work here: it also parses `cat bar` and
    the resulting concrete syntax tree is attached to the WORD [`cat
    bar`]. See the type definition for [word] below for more details.

    The PPX syntax extension package "visitors", written by François
    Pottier, is used to macro-generate many traversal functions over
    this concrete syntax tree. Note that we expose the .ml file of
    this module because the types generated by [visitors] are too
    complex to be displayed.
